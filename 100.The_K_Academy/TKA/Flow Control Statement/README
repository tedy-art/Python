Flow control statement:-
A program's control flow is the order in ehich the program's code executes.
The control floe of python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls.

Flow control system :-
1] Conditional Statement
2] Iterative Statement
3] Transfer Statement

1] Conditional statement :->
According to some condition if i want to execute some block of code we can use conditional
statement.

Types of Conditional statement :->
i]   if statement
ii]  if_else statement
iii] if_elif_else Statement

i] if statement :->
    syntax:
        if condition :
            if_body

    e.g.
    age = 19
    if age > 18:
        print("You are Eligible.")
    o/p:
    You are Eligible.
here,
if  -> if is a keyword and it is used to start the if statement.
    -> conditional can be anything and o/p of condition is always in  boolean(True/False)
    -> If the condition is True then the if block execute.
Indentation
    -> 4 space

ii] if_else statement :->
    Syntax:-
        if condition:
            if_block
        else:
            else_block

    e.g.
    age = 16
    if age > 18:
        print("You are eligible.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible.")
o/p:
    You are not eligible.

iii] if_elif_else statement:->
syntax:
    if condition:
        if_block
    elif condition:
        elif_block
    else:
        else_block

e.g.
    marks = 85
    if marks > 90:
        print("Grade A")
    elif marks > 80 and marks < 90:
        print("Grade B")
    elif marks > 60 and marks < 80:
        print("Grade C")
    else:
        print("You are Fail..")


here,
-> if the condition is greater than one then we will use if-elif-else statement.
