7)Tuple
-> Tuple is exactly same like list. The only diff is list is mutable and Tuple is Immutable

** What is Tuple??
-> List is ordered, Immutable, heterogeneous collection elements where insertion us preserved
    and duplicates are allowed
        immutable -> Non Changeable

** How to create tuple??
syntax :-
    var_name = ()
    type(var_name) #<class 'tuple'>

e.g.
    t = (10, 20, 30, 40)

** How to access data from tuple object ??
-> by using index and slice

 my_tuple = ("apple","Banana","Cherry")
 print(my_tuple[1])
 print(my_tuple[-1])
 o/p:
    Banana
    Cherry

** What is the defferance between list and Tuple ??
        list
1)Mutable
2)Comma separated value inside
  square brackets
3)Unpacking of data is possible.
4)if data is growable means changeable then use list.
5)List is slower than tuple

        Tuple
1)Immutable
2)Comma separed value inside round brackets.
3)Packing and unpacking of data both are possible.
4)If data is fixed or static then use tuple.
5)Tuple faster than list.
