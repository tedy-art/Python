8] SET
-> It is Un-ordered, Mutable, Heterogenious collection of immutable elements Where insertion
   order is NOT preserved and duplicates is not allowed.
* Un-ordered -> no index is present.

** How to create set object??
syntax :
    var_name = set(sequence)
    type(var_name) #<class 'set'>

** How to add data into set??
-> by using add method
syntax:
    var_name = set()
    var_name.add()

e.g.:
    var_name = set()
    var_name.add(10)

** How to remove data from set??
-> by using remove method
syntax :
    var_name = set()
    var_name.remove(value)

e.g.:
    var_name = set()
    var_name.remove(10)
EX>
s = set()
print(s, type(s), id(s))

s.add('INSTAGRAM')
print(s, type(s), id(s))
s.add(10)
s.add(20.5)
s.add("SAI")
s.add(10)
print(s, type(s), id(s))

l1 = (10, 20, 30, 40)
s.add(l1)
print(s, type(s), id(s))

** How to access set data
-> by using for loop

syntax:
     for temp_var in sequence:
        for_loop_body
        state_1
        state_2
        .....

for -> keyword
temp_var -> temporary variable
sequence -> means more than one elements e.g. list, tuple, str, set, frozenset, dict, range, etc...
: -> means end of loop header part
4 space -> This is standard 4 spaces Indentation.

***Frozenset***
->  It is exactly same as set the only diff is set is mutable and frozen set is
    immutable
->  It is Un-ordered, IM-Mutable, Heterogenious collection of immutable elements Where
    insertion order is NOT preserved and duplicates is not allowed.

syntax :
    var_name = frozenset(sequence)
