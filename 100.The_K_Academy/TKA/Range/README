9] Range data types
-> This will return sequence of whole number.

there are three ways  to use range function:
1] range(n):
-> This will return sequence of 0 to n-1 whole number.
e.g.
    r = range(10)
    for i in r:
         print(r)

2] range(start_val, stop_val):
-> This will return sequence of start value to end_value-1 whole numbers.
e.g.
    r = range(0,11)
    for i in r:
          print(i)

3] range(start_val, end_val, step_val):
-> This will return sequence of start value to end_value-1 whole number with specified
   step value
   e.g.
   r = range(2,11,2)
   for i in r:
          print(i)
