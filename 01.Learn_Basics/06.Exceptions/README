Excaeption:
A Python program terminates as soon as it encounters an error. In Python, an error can
be a syntax error or an exception. In this article, you will see what an exception is
and how it differs from a syntax error. After that, you will learn about raising
exceptions and making assertions. Then, youâ€™ll finish with a demonstration of the try
and except block.

tyr:-
The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
except:-
The except block lets you handle the error.
else:-
The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.
finally:-
The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try-
and except blocks.
