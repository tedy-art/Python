Data structure and algorithms:-
    A computer program is a collection of instructions to perform a specific task.
    For this, a computer program may need to store data, retrieve data, and perform
    computations on the data.

    A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data.
    And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.
What is an Algorithm?
    In this tutorial, we will learn what algorithms are with the help of examples.

    In computer programming terms, an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions
    to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input(s) and produces the desired
    output. For example,

An algorithm to add two numbers:
    1)Take two number inputs
    2)Add numbers using the + operator
    3)Display the result

Qualities of a Good Algorithm
    1)Input and output should be defined precisely.
    2)Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
    3)Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
    4)An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should
    be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.

Algorithm 1: Add two numbers entered by the user
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables num1, num2 and sum.
Step 3: Read values num1 and num2.
Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to sum.
        sum←num1+num2
Step 5: Display sum
Step 6: Stop

Algorithm 2: Find the largest number among three numbers
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables a,b and c.
Step 3: Read variables a,b and c.
Step 4: If a > b
           If a > c
              Display a is the largest number.
           Else
              Display c is the largest number.
        Else
           If b > c
              Display b is the largest number.
           Else
              Display c is the greatest number.
Step 5: Stop
